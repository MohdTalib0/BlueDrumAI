🤖 **How AI can help you spot relationship red flags before it's too late**

We've all heard stories of people who wish they'd saved that threatening message. Or that conversation where someone made false promises. Or that chat that showed manipulation patterns.

**But how do you analyze thousands of messages?**

Introducing **Red Flag Radar** - our AI-powered chat analyzer:

📱 **Multi-platform support:**
- WhatsApp exports
- SMS conversations  
- Email threads
- Manual text input

🔍 **What it detects:**
- Threats and intimidation
- Extortion patterns
- Manipulation tactics
- False allegations
- Isolation attempts
- Financial coercion

📊 **What you get:**
- Risk score (0-100)
- Detailed analysis
- Pattern detection
- Actionable recommendations
- Lawyer-ready PDF report

**Real example:**
A user uploaded 6 months of WhatsApp chats. Our AI detected:
- 12 high-risk threats
- 8 manipulation patterns
- 3 extortion attempts
- Risk score: 78/100

**Result:** They were able to present this analysis to their lawyer, strengthening their case significantly.

**A tool I wish existed 2 years ago** 💭

Two years ago, I went through a messy divorce. The biggest challenge? Organizing evidence. Screenshots, WhatsApp chats, emails, receipts - everything was scattered.

My lawyer asked for a timeline. I spent weeks manually organizing files. Some had wrong dates. Some were missing metadata. It was a nightmare.

**Then I found Blue Drum AI** (currently in waitlist).

This platform does exactly what I needed:
✅ Stores evidence with automatic timestamps
✅ Analyzes chat conversations for red flags
✅ Tracks income/expenses for alimony cases
✅ Generates lawyer-ready PDFs

**The AI chat analyzer is incredible.** I uploaded 8 months of WhatsApp chats, and it identified:
- 15 threatening messages I'd missed
- 8 manipulation patterns
- Risk score: 82/100

My lawyer was impressed. The organized evidence made my case stronger.

**If you're going through or anticipating a relationship dispute, join their waitlist.** Early access gets you lifetime discounts.
